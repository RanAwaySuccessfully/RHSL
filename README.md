# RHSL Color Picker
**RHSL** is a lightweight color picker that uses the HSL color space, and alternatively supports [HSLuv](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv). It's made to be very easy for developers to implement on their website, and also very easy for the end user to utilize.

After adding the color picker's files to your webpage, you only need to add the "rhslcolor" attribute to any &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt; element to link it to RHSL. More information below:
